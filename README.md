# Which Is Heavier?

### Play it! https://samgpu.itch.io/which-is-heavier

**Which Is Heavier?** is a web-based game created for the **Gamedev.js Jam 2025**. The theme of the jam is **"Balance"**, and this game challenges players to balance sets of animals against each other and determine which side is heavier. The game combines physics-based interactions, 3D rendering, and quick decision-making to create a fun and engaging experience.

## Gameplay

In **Which Is Heavier?**, players are presented with two sets of animals on platforms. Each set contains a random number of animals of a specific type. The goal is to choose the side with the **heavier total weight** before the timer runs out.

- Each animal has a predefined weight.
- The total weight of a set is calculated as `weight Ã— number of animals`.
- If you choose correctly, you score a point, and new sets of animals are generated.
- If you choose incorrectly or run out of time, the game ends.

## Features

- **3D Graphics**: Built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering and physics-based interactions.
- **Physics Simulation**: Platforms tilt and react dynamically using [Cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es).
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for correct and incorrect choices using [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/).
- **Randomized Gameplay**: Each round generates random sets of animals, ensuring replayability.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
